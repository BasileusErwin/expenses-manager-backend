# Expenses Project

This was a simple project for managing my expenses.
The goal is to have a project in my portfolio and use it for my personal expenses.

## Technologies

It is made with Node.js and TypeScript with Express.js framework, sequelize as ORM,
and [Rome](https://rome.tools) as linter and formatter. And as database PostgreSQL and Redis for the sessions.

It is deployed in [Railway](https://railway.app) and is running on Docker.
In development we used docker-compose to build the whole project. And to run the tests in Github Actions.
